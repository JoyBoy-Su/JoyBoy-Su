Hi, everyone. I am a 2020 undergraduate software engineering student of Fudan University. 
At present, I am reading some classic books related to machine learning: PRML, deep learning, etc
At the same time, I am working on a project in the direction of MSS (music source separation), based on demucs model and making some improvements. Welcome to contact me if you are interested in this project
